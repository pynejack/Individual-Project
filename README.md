# Individual-Project
This contains all files I used to run tandem flapping foil simulations for my third year individual project

- Things to include and explain
  -   lotus.f90
  -       Add more text to file to explain my input parameters   
  -   post processing scripts

  -   calibration files

The lotus.f90 file included here is the edited for the base case of a Strouhal number of 0.4 with an amplitude and frequency ratio of 1

The analysis file is used as the post-processing and will group and average the data for each case, it will print the thrust, power and efficiency values for both the hind and fore foils
